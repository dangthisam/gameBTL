Main Issues Summary
After a thorough review, here are the key issues with the code:

Incorrect Object Initialization Order: The create_fighters() method uses attributes before they're defined. The most critical fix is to move the initialization of position variables before they're used.
Fighter Creation Logic: The fighters are never actually created because create_fighters() is defined but not called at the right time in the code flow.
Character Selection Logic: The character selection logic doesn't correctly handle the relationship between local selection and server confirmation.
Error Handling: There's limited error handling for the various states the game can be in, particularly around network delays and synchronization.
Resource Loading: Some resources might be referenced before they're loaded.

Recommended Fixes:

Move the fighter position initialization before their use
Add proper calls to create_fighters() after character selection
Improve synchronization between client and server for character selection
Add better error handling for network and state issues
Ensure all resources are loaded before use

The most likely issue causing your errors is the initialization order problem, where the code is trying to use fighter_1_initial_x and related variables before they're assigned values. The fixes I've provided should address the most critical issues.
